## Introduction

All template libraries suck. But sometimes they are useful, for 
quick n' dirty building of documents. This template library will of course suck
as well. It is inspired by _why's markaby. It supports JSON and XML.

## Usage - Jump Start

Its fairly simple:

1. Create classes that inherit from MarkUS, and add templates with a name to them (see below). 
2. In the templates use arbitrary code, mixed with functions that have an _ at the end. 
3. Everything with an _ at the end is added to the result buffer
  - If the first parameter is a String or Integer it will be used as content of the element
  - If any parameter is a Hash it will be used as attributes in XML, or you-know-what in JSON
  - If any parameter is an Array it will be used as you-know-what in JSON
  - If it has a block, a nested data structure is implied (see template examples below)
  - JSON only: by default a Hash is assumed, if you pass a paramter `array`, e.g. `value_ do |array| ... end`, the result is `"value": [ ... ]`
  - `#template_!` is a special method to include other templates
  - `#element_!` allows you to include stuff in your result that is not a valid ruby function name (e.g. with a dot in the name - see below)
4. Get the result by instantiating the class and calling one of `#json_!`, `#xml_!`, `#html_!`
  - `#xml_!` and `#html_!` differ in the way elements with no content are printed. XML uses short-handed tags, HTML doesn't.

`#json_!`, `#xml_!` and `#html_!` need the name of the template as
the first parameter, optional you can pass a hash. All pairs in the hash are
available as instance variables. Of course you can also handle it yourself through a
constructor in the template class.

## Usage - Example

template1.rb:
```ruby
class Common < MarkUS
  template :test1 do
    query_ [2, 3, @w]
  end
  template :test2 do
    query_ :a => 2, :b => @h
  end
end
```

template2.rb:
```ruby
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/template1')

class Something < MarkUS
  templates Common                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

  indent

  template :main do
    template_! :test1
    template_! :test2
  end
end
```

main.rb:
```ruby
  require 'markus'
  require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/template2')
  s = Something.new
  result = s.json_! :main, :h => 'hello', :w => 'world'
  puts result
```

If you add `reload` to any of the template classes, they will be reloaded if they change (if templates are use in a long-running service).



## HTML Example Template

```ruby
html_ do
  body_ :class => 'test' do
    a_ 'Ruby', :href => 'https://ruby-lang.org'
    span_ do
      'Some Text'
    end
  end
end
```

## JSON Example Template

```ruby
query_ do
  filtered_ do
    filter_ do
      bool_ do
        must_ do |array|
          nested_ do
            path_ "contact"
            query_ do
              term_ do
                element_! "contact.durchwahl", 1
              end
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Why the f**k would i use a template library for JSON when i can just create a
big hash or array and create a json out of it? If you ever find yourself feeling bad or
lost with your big hashes, try this out. Maybe you like it, maybe not. Who
knows.

## Installation

* You need a least ruby 1.9.2

## Further Reading

View the example in the ./examples subdirectory. View the tests in the ./test subdirectory. From there you should be able to figure it out yourself. Tip: neat combinations with heredocs are possible, e.g. to create script tags in html.

```ruby
  script_ <<~end
    var foo = "bar";
  end
```
