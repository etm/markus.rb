== Introduction

All template libraries suck. But sometimes they are useful, for building
quick'n dirty creation of documents. This template library will of course suck
as well. It is inspired by _why's markaby. It supports JSON and XML.

== HTML Example Template

    html_ do
      body_ :class => 'test' do
        a_ 'Ruby', :href => 'https://ruby-lang.org' 
        span_ do
          'Some Text'                                                                                                                                        
        end
      end
    end

== JSON Example Template

    query_ do
      filtered_ do
        filter_ do
          bool_ do
            must_ do |array|
              nested_ do
                path_ "contact"
                query_ do
                  term_ do
                    element_! "contact.durchwahl", 1
                  end
                end
              end
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end

Why the f**k would i use a template library for JSON when i can just create a
big hash, and create a json out of it? If you ever find yourself feeling bad or
lost with your big hashes, try this out. Maybe you like it, maybe not. Who
knows.
